# YmsCoreBluetooth

A framework for building Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy (aka Smart or LE) iOS applications using the CoreBluetooth API. Includes Deanna, an iOS application using YmsCoreBluetooth to communicate with a [TI SensorTag](http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Bluetooth_SensorTag).

# Changes

## Sun Mar  3 18:57:23 PST 2013
* First stable release.
* Support for communication with all sensors/services on a SensorTag.
* Initial documentation for YmsCoreBluetooth API and Deanna source code.

# Notes

To sucessfully run this code using the iOS Simulator, you *must* use the iOS 5.1 simulator. At current (Sun Mar  3 18:57:23 PST 2013) the CoreBluetooth API for the iOS 6.x simulator is broken on XCode Version 4.6 (4H127).

Code tested on:

* iPhone 4S, iOS 6.1.2
* iOS 5.1 Simulator using Cirago Bluetooth 4.0 Mini USB Adapter
