Includes Deanna, an iOS application using YmsCoreBluetooth to communicate with a [TI SensorTag](http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Bluetooth_SensorTag).\r\n\r\n[YmsCoreBluetooth API Reference](http://kickingvegas.github.io/YmsCoreBluetooth/appledoc/hierarchy.html)\r\n\r\n## File Naming Conventions\r\n\r\nThe YmsCoreBluetooth framework is the set of files prefixed with `YMSCB`. These file are located in the folder `YmsCoreBluetooth`.\r\n\r\nThe files for the iOS application **Deanna** are prefixed with `DEA`.\r\n\r\n## Organizational Structure & Operation\r\n\r\nThe organizational structure of the YmsCoreBluetooth framework largely mirrors the CoreBluetooth hierarchy:\r\n\r\n* YMSCBAppService - An application service which manages multiple BLE peripherals\r\n    * YMSCBPeripheral - A BLE peripheral can have multiple BLE services\r\n        * YMSCBService - A BLE service can have multiple BLE characteristics\r\n             * YMSCBCharacteristic \r\n\t     \r\n\t     \r\nWith CoreBluetooth, the API to issue read and write requests to a BLE peripheral is accomplished through the CBPeripheral class and the responses sent back are handled via CBPeripheralDelegate methods. For a BLE peripheral with multiple services, this approach requires the developer to write code to manage read/write requests to different services.\r\n        \r\nYmsCoreBluetooth framework offers iOS developers a more natural API that is BLE service-centric: read and write requests to a BLE peripheral are done from the point of view of a BLE service. Responses can be handled using \r\na callback block or via a notification handler method.\r\n\r\n## YmsCoreBluetooth by Example: DEATemperatureService, a subclass of YMSCBService\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate the BLE service-centric API in action, below is the implementation of the temperature service for a TI SensorTag. \r\n\r\n\t@implementation DEATemperatureService\r\n\t- (id)initWithName:(NSString *)oName\r\n\t\t\t\tbaseHi:(int64_t)hi\r\n\t\t\t\tbaseLo:(int64_t)lo {\r\n\t\tself = [super initWithName:oName\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbaseHi:hi\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbaseLo:lo];\r\n\t\tif (self) {\r\n\t\t\t[self addCharacteristic:@\"service\" withOffset:kSensorTag_TEMPERATURE_SERVICE];\r\n\t\t\t[self addCharacteristic:@\"data\" withOffset:kSensorTag_TEMPERATURE_DATA];\r\n\t\t\t[self addCharacteristic:@\"config\" withOffset:kSensorTag_TEMPERATURE_CONFIG];\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\treturn self;\r\n\t}\r\n\t- (void)notifyCharacteristicHandler:(YMSCBCharacteristic *)yc error:(NSError *)error {\r\n\t\tif (error) {\r\n\t\t\treturn;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\tif ([yc.name isEqualToString:@\"data\"]) {\r\n\t\t\tNSData *data = yc.cbCharacteristic.value;\r\n\t\t\tchar val[data.length];\r\n\t\t\t[data getBytes:&val length:data.length];\r\n\t\t\tint16_t v0 = val[0];\r\n\t\t\tint16_t v1 = val[1];\r\n\t\t\tint16_t v2 = val[2];\r\n\t\t\tint16_t v3 = val[3];\r\n\t\t\tint16_t amb = ((v2 & 0xff)| ((v3 << 8) & 0xff00));\r\n\t\t\tint16_t objT = ((v0 & 0xff)| ((v1 << 8) & 0xff00));\r\n\t\t\tdouble tempAmb = calcTmpLocal(amb);\r\n\t\t\tself.ambientTemp = [NSNumber numberWithDouble:tempAmb];\r\n\t\t\tself.objectTemp = [NSNumber numberWithDouble:calcTmpTarget(objT, tempAmb)];\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t- (void)turnOn {\r\n\t\t[self writeByte:0x1 forCharacteristicName:@\"config\" type:CBCharacteristicWriteWithoutResponse];\r\n\t\t[self setNotifyValue:YES forCharacteristicName:@\"data\"];\r\n\t\tself.isOn = YES;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t- (void)turnOff {\r\n\t\t[self writeByte:0x0 forCharacteristicName:@\"config\" type:CBCharacteristicWriteWithoutResponse];\r\n\t\t[self setNotifyValue:NO forCharacteristicName:@\"data\"];\r\n\t\tself.isOn = NO;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t@end\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the class constructor [DEATemperatureService initWithName:baseHi:baseLo:], three BLE characteristics are specified: `service`, `data`, and `config` using defined address offsets to the 128-bit base address specified by `hi` and `lo`.\r\n\r\nDEATemperatureService can be turned on or off via the `turnOn` and `turnOff` methods respectively (these methods are actually found in DEABaseService which DEATemperatureService inherits from, but presented here for convenience).\r\n\r\nWhen notification for the `data` characteristic is turned on, the [DEATemperatureService notifyCharacteristicHandler:error:]\r\nimplementation handles the response from the BLE peripheral. With `notifyCharacteristicHandler:error:`, its implementation can be written to arbitrarily handle notifications from any specified notifying-enabled characteristic.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Callback Block Example\r\n\r\nThe implementation of DEADeviceInfoService (shown in abbreivated form below) illustrates an example of using an ObjC block to implement a response callback function. This callback is executed upon the response for a request, in this case for the read request of the `system_id` and `model_number` BLE characteristic.\r\n\r\n\t@implementation DEADeviceInfoService\r\n\t- (id)initWithName:(NSString *)oName\r\n\t\t\t\tbaseHi:(int64_t)hi\r\n\t\t\t\tbaseLo:(int64_t)lo {\r\n\t\tself = [super initWithName:oName\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbaseHi:hi\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbaseLo:lo];\r\n\t\tif (self) {\r\n\t\t\t[self addCharacteristic:@\"service\" withAddress:kSensorTag_DEVINFO_SERV_UUID];\r\n\t\t\t[self addCharacteristic:@\"system_id\" withAddress:kSensorTag_DEVINFO_SYSTEM_ID];\r\n\t\t\t[self addCharacteristic:@\"model_number\" withAddress:kSensorTag_DEVINFO_MODEL_NUMBER];\r\n\t\t\t[self addCharacteristic:@\"serial_number\" withAddress:kSensorTag_DEVINFO_SERIAL_NUMBER];\r\n\t\t\t[self addCharacteristic:@\"firmware_rev\" withAddress:kSensorTag_DEVINFO_FIRMWARE_REV];\r\n\t\t\t[self addCharacteristic:@\"hardware_rev\" withAddress:kSensorTag_DEVINFO_HARDWARE_REV];\r\n\t\t\t[self addCharacteristic:@\"software_rev\" withAddress:kSensorTag_DEVINFO_SOFTWARE_REV];\r\n\t\t\t[self addCharacteristic:@\"manufacturer_name\" withAddress:kSensorTag_DEVINFO_MANUFACTURER_NAME];\r\n\t\t\t[self addCharacteristic:@\"ieee11073_cert_data\" withAddress:kSensorTag_DEVINFO_11073_CERT_DATA];\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\treturn self;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t- (void)readDeviceInfo {\r\n\t\t[self readValueForCharacteristicName:@\"system_id\" withBlock:^(NSData *data, NSError *error) {\r\n\t\t\tNSMutableString *tmpString = [NSMutableString stringWithFormat:@\"\"];\r\n\t\t\tunsigned char bytes[data.length];\r\n\t\t\t[data getBytes:bytes];\r\n\t\t\tfor (int ii = data.length; ii >= 0;ii--) {\r\n\t\t\t\t[tmpString appendFormat:@\"%02hhx\",bytes[ii]];\r\n\t\t\t\tif (ii) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\t[tmpString appendFormat:@\":\"];\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t\tNSLog(@\"system id: %@\", tmpString);\r\n\t\t\tself.system_id = tmpString;\r\n\r\n\t\t}];\r\n\r\n\t\t[self readValueForCharacteristicName:@\"model_number\" withBlock:^(NSData *data, NSError *error) {\r\n\t\t\tif (error) {\r\n\t\t\t\tNSLog(@\"ERROR: %@\", error);\r\n\t\t\t\treturn;\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t\tNSString *payload = [[NSString alloc] initWithData:data encoding:NSStringEncodingConversionAllowLossy];\r\n\t\t\tself.model_number = payload;\r\n\t\t\tNSLog(@\"model: %@\", payload);\r\n\t\t}];\r\n\t}\r\n\t@end\r\n\r\n\r\n## Recommended Code Walk Through\r\n\r\nTo better understand how YmsCoreBluetooth works, it is recommended to first read the source of the following BLE service implementations:\r\n\r\n* DEAAccelerometerService, DEABarometerService, DEAGyroscopeService, DEAHumidityService, DEAMagnetometerService, DEASimpleKeysService, DEATemperatureService\r\n\r\nThen the BLE peripheral implementation of the TI SensorTag:\r\n\r\n* DEASensorTag\r\n\r\nThen the application service which manages all known peripherals:\r\n\r\n* DEACBAppService\r\n\r\nThe [Class Hierarchy](http://kickingvegas.github.io/YmsCoreBluetooth/appledoc/hierarchy.html) is very instructive in showing the relationship of the above classes to the YmsCoreBluetooth framework.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Writing your own Bluetooth LE service with YmsCoreBluetooth\r\n\r\nLearn how to write your own Bluetooth LE service by reading the example of how its done for the TI SensorTag in the [Tutorial](http://kickingvegas.github.io/YmsCoreBluetooth/appledoc/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.html).\r\n\r\n## Questions\r\n\r\nWhile quite functional, YmsCoreBluetooth is still very much in an early state and there's always room for improvement. Please submit any questions or [issues to the GitHub project for YmsCoreBluetooth](https://github.com/kickingvegas/YmsCoreBluetooth/issues?labels=&milestone=&page=1&state=open).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\nCode tested on:\r\n\r\n* iPhone 4S, iOS 6.1.3\r\n* TI SensorTag firmware 1.2, 1.3.\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n* Detailed Documentation including Tutorial. This is forthcoming.\r\n* No support is offered for the iOS simulator due to the instability of the CoreBluetooth implementation on it. Use this code only on iOS hardware that supports CoreBluetooth. Given that Apple does not provide technical support for CoreBluetooth behavior on the iOS simulator [TN2295](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#technotes/tn2295/_index.html), I feel this is a reasonable position to take. Hopefully in time the iOS simulator will exhibit better CoreBluetooth fidelity.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n### Wed May 2 2013\r\n* Issue #34 - Updated YmsCoreBluetooth Documentation\r\n\r\n### Wed May 1 2013\r\n* Improved API for reads and writes using either blocks or notifications.\r\n* Issue #12 - Callback blocks for service requests implemented.\r\n* Issue #22 - Support for reading SensorTag device info implemented.\r\n* Issue #24 - API version implemented.\r\n* Bugfix #31 - Remove all UI dependencies in YmsCoreBluetooth.
