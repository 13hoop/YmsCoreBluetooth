Includes Deanna, an iOS application using YmsCoreBluetooth to communicate with a [TI SensorTag](http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Bluetooth_SensorTag).\r\n\r\n[YmsCoreBluetooth API Reference](http://kickingvegas.github.io/YmsCoreBluetooth/appledoc/index.html)\r\n\r\n## File Naming Conventions\r\n\r\nThe YmsCoreBluetooth framework is the set of files prefixed with `YMSCB` located in the directory `YmsCoreBluetooth`.\r\n\r\nThe files for the iOS application **Deanna** are prefixed with `DEA` located in the directory `Deanna`.\r\n\r\n## Organizational Structure & Operation\r\n\r\nThe organizational structure of the YmsCoreBluetooth framework largely mirrors the CoreBluetooth hierarchy:\r\n\r\n* YMSCBAppService - An application service which manages multiple BLE peripherals\r\n    * YMSCBPeripheral - A BLE peripheral can have multiple BLE services\r\n        * YMSCBService - A BLE service can have multiple BLE characteristics\r\n             * YMSCBCharacteristic \r\n\t     \r\n\t     \r\nWith CoreBluetooth, the API to issue read and write requests to a BLE peripheral is accomplished through the CBPeripheral class and the responses sent back are handled via CBPeripheralDelegate methods. For a BLE peripheral with multiple services, this approach requires the developer to write code to manage read/write requests to different services.\r\n        \r\nYmsCoreBluetooth framework offers iOS developers a more natural API that is BLE service-centric: **read and write requests to a BLE peripheral are done from the point of view of a BLE service**. Responses can be handled using a callback block or via a notification handler method.\r\n\r\n## Recommended Code Walk Through\r\n\r\nTo better understand how YmsCoreBluetooth works, it is recommended to first read the source of the following BLE service implementations:\r\n\r\n* DEAAccelerometerService, DEABarometerService, DEAGyroscopeService, DEAHumidityService, DEAMagnetometerService, DEASimpleKeysService, DEATemperatureService\r\n\r\nThen the BLE peripheral implementation of the TI SensorTag:\r\n\r\n* DEASensorTag\r\n\r\nThen the application service which manages all known peripherals:\r\n\r\n* DEACBAppService\r\n\r\nThe [Class Hierarchy](http://kickingvegas.github.io/YmsCoreBluetooth/appledoc/hierarchy.html) is very instructive in showing the relationship of the above classes to the YmsCoreBluetooth framework.\r\n\r\n## Writing your own Bluetooth LE service with YmsCoreBluetooth\r\n\r\nLearn how to write your own Bluetooth LE service by reading the example of how its done for the TI SensorTag in the [Tutorial](http://kickingvegas.github.io/YmsCoreBluetooth/appledoc/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.html).\r\n\r\n## Questions\r\n\r\nWhile quite functional, YmsCoreBluetooth is still very much in an early state and there's always room for improvement. Please submit any questions or [issues to the GitHub project for YmsCoreBluetooth](https://github.com/kickingvegas/YmsCoreBluetooth/issues?labels=&milestone=&page=1&state=open).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\nCode tested on:\r\n\r\n* iPhone 4S, iOS 6.1.3\r\n* TI SensorTag firmware 1.2, 1.3.\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n* No support is offered for the iOS simulator due to the instability of the CoreBluetooth implementation on it. Use this code only on iOS hardware that supports CoreBluetooth. Given that Apple does not provide technical support for CoreBluetooth behavior on the iOS simulator [TN2295](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#technotes/tn2295/_index.html), I feel this is a reasonable position to take. Hopefully in time the iOS simulator will exhibit better CoreBluetooth fidelity.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n### Sun May 12 2013 - Moombahton Release (ver 0.92)\r\n* Block-based callbacks for central manager scanning, peripheral connection, and peripheral retrieval are now supported.\r\n* Watchdog timeout for unanswered peripheral connection requests are now supported.\r\n* Significant API changes to YMSCBAppService and YMSCBPeripheral detailed below.\r\n\r\n#### API 0.92 Changes\r\n\r\n<table border='1'>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr><td colspan='2'><code>YMSCBAppService</code></td></tr>\r\n<tr><td>obsolete</td><td><code>- (void)persistPeripherals</code></td><td>Replaced by YMSCBStoredPeripherals</td></tr>\r\n<tr><td>obsolete</td><td><code>- (void)loadPeripherals</code></td><td>Replaced by YMSCBStoredPeripherals</td></tr>\r\n<tr><td>new</td><td><code>- (id)initWithKnownPeripheralNames:(NSArray *)nameList<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;queue:(dispatch_queue_t)queue<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;useStoredPeripherals:(BOOL)useStore;</code></td><td>Add support to optionally store peripherals.</td></tr>\r\n<tr><td>obsolete</td><td><code>- (void)connectPeripheral:(NSUInteger)index;</code></td><td rowspan='2'>Use more accurate name</td></tr>\r\n<tr><td>replaced by</td><td><code>- (void)connectPeripheralAtIndex:(NSUInteger)index<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;options:(NSDictionary *)options;</code></td></tr>\r\n<tr><td>obsolete</td><td><code>- (void)disconnectPeripheral:(NSUInteger)index;</code></td><td rowspan='2'>Use more accurate name.</td></tr>\r\n<tr><td>replaced by</td><td><code>- (void)disconnectPeripheralAtIndex:(NSUInteger)index;</code></td></tr>\r\n<tr><td>new</td><td><code>- (void)connectPeripheral:(YMSCBPeripheral *)peripheral<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;options:(NSDictionary *)options;</code></td><td>Mirror CBCentralManager method</td></tr>\r\n<tr><td>new</td><td><code>- (void)cancelPeripheralConnection:(YMSCBPeripheral *)peripheral;</code></td><td>Mirror CBCentralManager method</td></tr>\r\n<tr><td>new</td><td><code>- (void)connectPeripheral:(YMSCBPeripheral *)peripheral<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;options:(NSDictionary *)options<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;withBlock:(void (^)(YMSCBPeripheral *yp, NSError *error))connectCallback</code></td><td>Support block based connection</td></tr>\r\n<tr><td>new</td><td><code>- (void)retrieveConnectedPeripherals</code></td><td>Mirror CBCentralManager method</td></tr>\r\n<tr><td>new</td><td><code>- (void)retrieveConnectedPeripheralsWithBlock:<br>(void (^)(CBPeripheral *peripheral))retrieveCallback</code></td><td>Support block based connection</td></tr>\r\n<tr><td>new</td><td><code>- (void)retrievePeripherals:(NSArray *)peripheralUUIDs</code></td><td>Mirror CBCentralManager method</td></tr>\r\n<tr><td>new</td><td><code>- (void)retrievePeripherals:(NSArray *)peripheralUUIDs<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;withBlock:(void (^)(CBPeripheral *peripheral))retrieveCallback</code></td><td>Support block based connection</td></tr>\r\n<tr><td>new</td><td><code>- (void)scanForPeripheralsWithServices:(NSArray *)serviceUUIDs<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;options:(NSDictionary *)options<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;withBlock:<br>(void (^)(CBPeripheral *,NSDictionary *, NSNumber *, NSError *))discoverCallback</code></td><td>Support block based connection</td></tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<table border='1'>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr><td colspan='2'><code>YMSCBPeripheral</code></td></tr>\r\n<tr><td>obsolete</td>\r\n<td><code>\r\n- (id)initWithPeripheral:(CBPeripheral *)peripheral\r\n    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;baseHi:(int64_t)hi\r\n    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;baseLo:(int64_t)lo\r\n    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;updateRSSI:(BOOL)update;\r\n</code></td><td rowspan='2'>Support parent property so that methods on parent can be called directly from an instance of YMSCBPeripheral.</td></tr>\r\n<tr><td>replaced by</td>\r\n<td><code>\r\n- (id)initWithPeripheral:(CBPeripheral *)peripheral\r\n    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;parent:(YMSCBAppService *)owner\r\n    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;baseHi:(int64_t)hi\r\n    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;baseLo:(int64_t)lo\r\n    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;updateRSSI:(BOOL)update;\r\n</code></td></tr>\r\n<tr><td>new</td><td><code>- (void)discoverServices</code></td><td>Convenience method to call behavior from YMSCBAppService</td></tr>\r\n<tr><td>new</td><td><code>- (void)connect</code></td><td>Convenience method to call behavior from YMSCBAppService</td></tr>\r\n<tr><td>new</td><td><code>- (void)disconnect</code></td><td>Convenience method to call behavior from YMSCBAppService</td></tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Wed May 8 2013\r\n* Issue #37 - UI for SensorTag Device Information Service implemented.\r\n\r\n### Tue May 7 2013\r\n* Bugfixes: #41, #42\r\n\r\n### Mon May 6 2013\r\n* Issue #19 - First draft of Tutorial written\r\n* Added initial support for launching a local notification when *Deanna* app in the background.
